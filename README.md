# jumbled
A collection of miscellaneous R functions that I have developed over the past several years.

# Installation
Presently this collection consists only of R scripts and is not a proper R package.
However, if there is much interest in the functions (please let me know, e.g., by "starring" or sending a message) I will turn them into a package.
But presently, users should just download the relevant scripts and load them in R in order to later use them, e.g.,

```
source("dfsumm.R")
```


# Feedback
These functions were primarily written for my own usage, but I hope others find them useful.
If you have any requests or find any bugs, submit them through the Issues page.
If you are interested in a package version of these functions, please let me know through the Issues page.
