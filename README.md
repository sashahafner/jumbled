# jumbled
A collection of miscellaneous R functions that I have developed over the past several years.

# Installation
Use the normal approach for GitHub.
You must have the devtools package installed (you can do this with, e.g., `> install.packages("devtools")`).
Then run:

```
devtools::install_github("sashahafner/jumbled")
```

# Feedback
These functions were primarily written for my own usage, but I hope others find them useful.
If you have any requests or find any bugs, submit them through the Issues page.
